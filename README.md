👋 Hi there, I'm @EsezaKironde!
🧬 Data Scientist by Day, Brain Explorer by Night
I'm a biostatistician-in-training who's passionate about using data to decode the mysteries of human health. Think of me as a detective who uses Python, R, and SAS instead of a magnifying glass!

👀 What Gets Me Excited?
Turning complex healthcare data into actionable insights that actually help people and making machine learning algorithms that can predict healthcare behaviors (because who doesn't love a good crystal ball?)

🌱 Currently Growing
-Deep diving into advanced survival analysis techniques
-Exploring the fascinating world of neural networks with TensorFlow/PyTorch

💞️ Let's Collaborate On
-Healthcare analytics projects that make a real impact
-Creative ways to make complex statistical concepts more accessible
-Anything involving machine learning in public health!
